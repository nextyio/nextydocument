<dt>escrow</dt><dd><p>If two mutually-untrusting entities are engaged in commerce, they may wish to pass funds through a mutually trusted third party and instruct that party to send the funds to the payee only when evidence of product delivery has been shown. This reduces the risk of the payer or payee committing fraud. Both this construction and the third party is called escrow.</p>

<dt>token system</dt><dd><p>A fungible virtual good that can be traded. More formally, a token system is a database mapping addresses to numbers with the property that the primary allowed operation is a transfer of N tokens from A to B, with the conditions that N is non-negative, N is not greater than A’s current balance, and a document authorizing the transfer is digitally signed by A. Secondary “issuance” and “consumption” operations may also exist, transaction fees may also be collected, and simultaneous multi-transfers with many parties may be possible. Typical use cases include currencies, cryptographic tokens inside of networks, company shares and digital gift cards.</p>

<dt>block</dt><dd><p>A block is a package of data that contains zero or more transactions, the hash of the previous block (“parent”), and optionally other data. The total set of blocks, with every block except for the initial “genesis block” containing the hash of its parent, is called the blockchain and contains the entire transaction history of a network. Note that some blockchain-based cryptocurrencies use the word “ledger” instead of blockchain; the two are roughly equivalent, although in systems that use the term “ledger” each block generally contains a full copy of the current state (e.g. currency balances, partially fulfilled contracts, registrations) of every account allowing users to discard outdated historical data.</p>

Web3.js and console functions accept addresses with or  without this prefix but for transparency we encourage their use. Since each byte of the address is represented by 2 hex characters, a prefixed address is  42 characters long. Several apps and APIs are also meant to implement the new <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/55">checksum-enabled address scheme</a>  introduced in the Mist Ethereum wallet as of version 0.5.0.</p>

<dt>frontier</dt><dd><p>Ethereum was planned to be released in four major steps with Frontier being the name for the first phase. The Frontier release went live on July 30th, 2015. The command line Frontier phase was mainly meant to get mining operations going with the full reward of 5 ether per block and also to promote the emergence of ether exchanges.

<dt>hash</dt><dd><p>A cryptographic function which takes an input (or ‘message’) and returns a fixed-size alphanumeric string, which is called the hash value (sometimes called a message digest, a digital fingerprint, a digest or a checksum). A hash function (or hash algorithm) is a process by which a document (i.e. a piece of data or file) is processed into a small piece of data (usually 32 bytes) which looks completely random, and from which no meaningful data can be recovered about the document, but which has the important property that the result of hashing one particular document is always the same. Additionally, it is crucially important that it is computationally infeasible to find two documents that have the same hash. Generally, changing even one letter in a document will completely randomize the hash; for example, the SHA3 hash of “Saturday” is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">c38bbc8e93c09f6ed3fe39b5135da91ad1a99d397ef16948606cdcbd14929f9d</span></code>, whereas the SHA3 hash of “Caturday” is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">b4013c0eed56d5a0b448b02ec1d10dd18c1b3832068fbbdc65b98fa9b14b6dbf</span></code>.

The attacker then creates a block, at the same level as the block containing the original transaction but containing the second transaction instead, and starts mining on the fork. If the attacker has more than 50% of all mining power, the double spend is guaranteed to succeed eventually at any block depth. Below 50%, there is some probability of success, but it is usually only substantial at a depth up to about 2-5; for this reason, most cryptocurrency exchanges, gambling sites and financial services wait until six blocks have been produced (“six confirmations”) before accepting a payment.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SPV client</dt><dd><p>A client that downloads only a small part of the blockchain, allowing users of low-power or low-storage hardware like smartphones and laptops to maintain almost the same guarantee of security by sometimes selectively downloading small parts of the state without needing to spend megabytes of bandwidth and gigabytes of storage on full blockchain validation and maintenance. See light client.</p>
</dd>
<dt>uncle</dt><dd><p>Uncles are blockchain blocks found by a miner, when a different miner has already found another block for the corresponding place in the blockchain. They are called “stale blocks”. The parent of an Uncle is an ancestor of the inserting block, located at the tip of the blockchain. In contrast to the Bitcoin network, Ethereum rewards stale blocks as well in order to avoid to penalize miners with a bad connection to the network. This is less critical in the Bitcoin network, because the Block Time there is much higher (~10 minutes) than on the Ethereum network (aimed to ~15 seconds).</p>
</dd>
<dt>GHOST</dt><dd><p>Greedy Heaviest-Observed Sub-Tree is an alternative chain-selection method that is designed to incentivize stale blocks (uncles) as well, thus reducing the incentive for pool mining. In GHOST, even the confirmation given by stale blocks to previous blocks are considered valid, and the miners of the stale blocks are also rewarded with a mining reward.</p>
</dd>
<dt>merkle patricia tree</dt><dd><p>Merkle Patricia trees provide a cryptographically authenticated data structure that can be used to store all (key, value) bindings. They are fully deterministic, meaning that a Patricia tree with the same (key,value) bindings is guaranteed to be exactly the same down to the last byte and therefore have the same root hash, provide O(log(n)) efficiency for inserts, lookups and deletes, and are much easier to understand and code than more complex comparison-based alternatives like red-black trees.</p>

<dt>CLL (obsolete)</dt><dd><p>Acronym for C Like Language, which Mutan was. This acronym has been phased out.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ES1, ES2, and ES3 (obsolete)</dt><dd><p>“Ethereum Script” versions 1,2 and 3. There were early versions of what would become the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).</p>
</dd>
<dt>log event</dt><dd><p>Contracts are triggered by transactions executed as part of the block verification. If conceived of as a function call, contract execution is asynchronous, and therefore they have no return value. Instead contracts communicate to the outside world with log events. The log events are part of the transaction receipt which is produced when the transaction is executed.
The receipts are stored in the receipt trie, the integrity of which is guaranteed by the fact that the current root of the receipt trie is part of the block header alongside the roots of state and state-trie. In a broad sense from the external perspective receipts are part of the Ethereum system state except that they are not readable contracts internally.</p>
