Nexty Poolmaster
################################################################################

Nexty users have the ability to mine NTY by depositing 50,000 NTF into Nexty Governance. However, the amount of NTF required to do so is excessively high for one account to acquire all 50,000 NTF for a sealing node, so Nexty Poolmaster was introduced. It is similar to pool mining in Bitcoin and Ethereum, but instead of sharing processing power over the network, users can stake their NTF token in the pool and receive NTY according to the percentage of their stakes.
